# AI-Generated Code Templates for Engineers

This repository contains a growing set of Python code templates and Jupyter notebooks designed to accelerate engineering workflows using automation and data-driven decision-making.

Whether you're loading process data, filtering noisy signals, plotting trends, or automating basic analyses, these tools help you go from ad hoc testing to reusable logic quickly.

The purpose of this repository is three-fold:
 - To help the author expand his understanding of Python, VS Code, and Github, building upon a foundation of MATLAB used in an academic research setting
 - To underatand how to effectively leverage natural lanaguge AI models to generate and optimize basic coding blocks (and learn how to teach other engineers how to leverge AI in the same way)
 - To generate a simple coding reference to enhance the analytical toolbox available to engineers and technical specialists who might not have a traditional coding background.
 
Code templates were generated using ChatGPT. Testing and Validation is done by Josh Villanueva.

## What's Inside

- `templates/`: Reusable Python functions for data loading, filtering, calculations, and plotting
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to apply the templates in real engineering scenarios
- `examples/`: Standalone scripts that show complete workflows for data analysis or process modeling

## Getting Started

**1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshtvill/ai-code-templates-for-engineers.git
cd ai-code-templates-for-engineers
```

**2. Install required packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Open in VS Code or Jupyter**

You can open `.py` files in any editor, or run `.ipynb` notebooks directly inside VS Code.

## Example Use Cases

- Load and clean process data from CSV logs
- Visualize trends across batches or runs
- Apply basic filtering and thresholds
- Create modular tools for reuse across notebooks or scripts
