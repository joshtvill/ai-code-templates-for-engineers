# Notebooks

This folder is reserved for optional Jupyter notebooks used during prototyping, exploratory analysis, or educational walkthroughs.

It is currently empty, but may be populated in future versions of this repository to demonstrate specific modeling logic, intermediate visualizations, or training concepts.

For finalized examples, please see the `/case_studies/` folder.
